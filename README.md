# skoggs.github.io
An interactive dashboard from a "belly button biodiversity" dataset. It can be viewed directly from the web by inserting the above address into your web browser.
It may also be accessed locally by cloning/downloading the repository. (Note that altering the directories may cause app.js to not load correctly.)

This pulls data from https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json,
then makes a few visualizations with Plotly and Javascript. 

When the "Test Subject ID No." dropdown is altered, the page elements will reload with the corresponding dataset for that test subject. Try out a few 
different ones!
